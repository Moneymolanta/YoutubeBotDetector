UgheL8KI3mypNngCoAEC,N0VEMBYR,2017-01-28T07:39:32,Dear Minecraft I know you are growing old now. Thank you for giving me so much joy as a kid.   Dear Minecraft I will never forget all of the times you had me excited just for finding a stupid diamond.   Dear Minecraft I appreciate all of the times you pulled me out of depression.  For all of the times you had me running down the street from the bus just to get on the computer and play for 6 hours straight.  Thank you for letting me be a kid.,"Fallen Kingdom" - A Minecraft Parody of Coldplay's Viva la Vida (Music Video),2
