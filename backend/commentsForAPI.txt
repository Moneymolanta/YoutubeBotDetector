What's concerning is that our system of governance has transformed to a place where those ill-conceived notions can become rule by decree.  What happened to checks-and-balances, co-equal branches of gov't?  A lot of clean-up of distribution of power is going to be necessary if we make it through these Trump years.",

(And I get that there was impetus from 30 year before.)This is a coup on the American people, whose education has been eroded by gov't, resulting in a very malleable & suggestable voter base  -- esp. given the shift of economic wealth to the top 1%. Social media, the erosion of main stream media - the erosion of truth has corrupted the foundation of reasonable decisions -- for the world. Scott, you saying that \"Trump is eating the chess pieces\" is so incredibly appropriate. We MUST keep fighting this. I like Kara's reference: we want Star Trek not Star Wars. And I love both Bernie and AOC. They are politicians that are actually for the everyday American -- and they have taken incredible flack for it. It's mind boggling. I agree that Sherrod was the best. A pretty relevant question is: why did he lose based on campaign money rather than his record and message??",
