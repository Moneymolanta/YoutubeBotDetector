git This confusion matrix shows two classes:

Class 0 (non-bot)

Class 1 (bot)

Rows represent the actual (true) class.

Columns represent the predicted class.

Reading each cell:

Top-left cell (198):

True Negatives (TN)

There are 198 comments that are actually non-bot (class 0), and the model correctly predicted them as non-bot.

Top-right cell (5):

False Positives (FP)

There are 5 comments that are actually non-bot, but the model incorrectly predicted them as bot.

Bottom-left cell (0):

False Negatives (FN)

There are 0 comments that are actually bot, but were incorrectly predicted as non-bot. (Perfect recall for the bot class!)

Bottom-right cell (245):

True Positives (TP)

There are 245 comments that are actually bots (class 1), and the model correctly predicted them as bots.

What It Means
The model correctly identifies almost all comments, with a very small number (5) of non-bot comments mislabeled as bots.

There are no missed bots (FN = 0), so the model never incorrectly labels a bot as non-bot.

Overall, this indicates extremely high accuracy and perfect recall for the bot class.
